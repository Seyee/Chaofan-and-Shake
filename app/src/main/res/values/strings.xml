    Swirls bread is a soft, fluffy loaf with a distinctive spiral pattern inside, often created by rolling layers of dough with flavorful fillings like cinnamon, chocolate, or ube. The exterior is golden brown, while the inside remains tender and slightly sweet. Each slice reveals a beautiful swirl, making it as visually appealing as it is delicious. Perfect for breakfast, snacks, or desserts, swirls bread pairs well with coffee, tea, or a simple spread of butter.
